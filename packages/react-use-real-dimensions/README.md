# react-use-real-dimensions 🕊️↔😌

So [react-use-dimensions](https://github.com/Swizec/useDimensions) will measure your rendered elements in place.

But **react-use-real-dimensions** will measure your elements in isolation, unconstrained by the rest of the page layout.

## Usage

Use it just like react-use-dimensions.
